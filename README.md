# Doc Type Grid Editor for Umbraco 9 (net core)

Hi there Umbraco Grid fans - this is my WIP of the port of Doc Type Grid Editor for the upcoming Umbraco 9.

First a few disclaimers
- I have never worked with .net core before. Don't expect me to be able to fix or answer everything.
- My goal is to have a comparable version of DTGE ready for v9
- I am probably going to need (a lot of) help fixing issues with this
- DTGE is in my opinion feature complete - I don't want to add any new features

Check out the issue tracker for known issues. All issues need help, so if you want to see DTGE happen for Umbraco 9, then this is where you are needed!
